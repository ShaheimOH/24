# The same 24 hours: The fallacy of a meritocracy in a neoliberal society 

## Part 1: Neoliberalism

Neoliberalism refers to market-oriented policies involving limited government intervention such as eliminating price controls, deregulating capital markets, and lowering trade barriers through privatisation (transferring state-run services to private businesses) and austerity (government spending cuts and higher taxes) [1].

The political ideology is said to be the most dominant political ideology of our time and it's fair to say that the UK is a neoliberal society. The conservative party commonly subscribe to this ideology and many of their policies have a neoliberal underpinning.

## Part 2: Meritocracy 

A meritocracy is a political system in which economic goods, political power and success are entirely attributed to an individual’s talent, effort and achievement rather than their wealth, social class, gender and race.

Or, if you work hard and are talented, you will be successful. 

Most individuals in favour of neoliberalism will state that _neoliberalism rewards the hardworking and productive while punishing the lazy, creating a better society_. Mutual beneficial exchange is the underlying concept for this ideology. Classic liberals and neoliberals thought that if individuals are productive and efficient in an economy, they will help everyone in turn as everyone gains from exchange. However, a critical difference between neoliberal mutual beneficial exchange and classical liberalism is that neoliberalism stresses losers within the economy that are not productive and, therefore, punished. Meanwhile, classical liberalism emphasises the overall gain for everyone. 


This all sounds great and perfect, but there is a crucial problem. The theorists of neoliberalism did not buy it. 

Friedrich Von Hayek, a major contributor to neoliberalism, stated in his famous book of the serfdom to freedom:

**_it is … a real dilemma to what extent we ought to encourage in the young the belief that when they try they will really succeed, or should rather emphasise that inevitably some unworthy will succeed and some worthy will fail._**

Hayek never stated a direct and robust relationship between working hard and succeeding in a neoliberal society. Instead, Hayek suggested the nobel lie _'of working hard can make you successful'_ is essential in sustaining a capitalistic society as this will maximise productivity.

**Therefore, to sustain a neoliberal and capitalistic society, a lie must be constructed of a meritocracy.**

## Part 3: Plaster over the cracks

The issue with lying is that it does not solve any problems. By ignoring factors that can limit an individual from succeeding does not lead society to a true meritocracy which is arguably in the best interest of everyone. Furthermore, these factors such as class, race and gender are very grounded in reality. 

- 20% of black Africans own their homes compared to 68% of their white British counterparts.

- Women lead 15% of small-medium sized enterprises. 

- Free school meal pupils are half as likely to attend a top higher education institute (Russel group).

**However, by accepting that there is no equality of outcomes for individuals who work hard, we can find actionable solutions to balance the scales.**
