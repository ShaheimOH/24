# The same 24 hours: The fallacy of a meritocracy in a neoliberal society 

## Part 1: Neoliberalism theory

Neoliberalism refers to market-oriented policies involving limited government intervention such as eliminating price controls, deregulating capital markets, and lowering trade barriers through privatisation (transferring state-run services to private businesses) and austerity (government spending cuts and higher taxes).

The poltical ideology is said to be the most dominant political ideology of our time. The conservative party commonly subscribe to this ideology and many of their policies have a neoliberal underpinning. Moreover, neoliberalism is heavily associated with Thatcherism, which saw the privatisation of state-run services, i.e. UK railway and British Telecommunications (BT).

### To simply put it...

Neoliberalism allows businesses to control the economy with limited government control. So, allowing a few big shots to influence a country’s economy heavily.

## Part 2: Meritocracy 

A meritocracy is a political system in which economic goods, political power and success are entirely attributed to an individual’s talent, effort and achievement rather than their wealth, social class, gender and race.

Or, if you work hard and are talented, you will be successful.
